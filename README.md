### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Auguste Baum! I'm a software engineer; talk to me about (in no particular order):
- functional programming
  - Particularly the "effect handlers" approach to side-effects (e.g. [koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/) and [unison](https://www.unison-lang.org/))
- Nix (I run NixOS by the way)
- Python, especially with Pydantic and Hypothesis; also Textual
- Rust
- RSS
- Alternative Git workflows (as in, not GitHub)
  - Happy user of [jj](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/)
- free-and-open-source software.

#### My professional experience

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a software engineer at [Probabl](probabl.ai).
- I am co-founder and former CTO of [Resilio](https://github.com/resilio), a start-up promoting digital sobriety through ad-hoc consulting (life-cycle assessments) and solutions to empower consultants.
- I got acquainted with Nix by working on [ngipkgs](https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs), a collection of Nix packages for [NGI](https://community.ngi.eu/)-funded software.
