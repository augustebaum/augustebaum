### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Auguste Baum! I'm a software developer interested in functional programming, Nix, Rust and free-and-open-source software. I have experience with machine learning pipelines and B2B applications.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working at [Resilio](https://github.com/resilio) on a digital sobriety solution.
- I worked on [ngipkgs](https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs), a collection of Nix packages for [NGI](https://community.ngi.eu/)-funded software.
