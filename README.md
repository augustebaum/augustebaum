### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Auguste Baum! I'm a software engineer; talk to me about (in no particular order):
- functional programming
- Nix (I run NixOS by the way)
- Python, especially with Pydantic and Hypothesis; also Textual
- Rust
- RSS
- Git Patch-Stack (currently trying out git-branchless)
- free-and-open-source software.

I have experience with machine learning pipelines and B2B applications.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a software engineer at [Probabl](probabl.ai).
- I am co-founder and former CTO of [Resilio](https://github.com/resilio), a start-up promoting digital sobriety through ad-hoc consulting (life-cycle assessments) and solutions to empower consultants.
- I got acquainted with Nix by working on [ngipkgs](https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs), a collection of Nix packages for [NGI](https://community.ngi.eu/)-funded software.
