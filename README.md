### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Auguste Baum! I'm a software developer interested in functional programming, Nix, Rust and free-and-open-source software.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ngipkgs](https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs), a collection of Nix packages for [NGI](https://community.ngi.eu/)-related software.
